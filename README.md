## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Basic Order Processing
```python
from src.order_processor import OrderProcessor
from src.schema import menu_database

# Initialize order processor
processor = OrderProcessor(menu_database)

# Process natural language order
order_text = "craving a McChicken with large fries and medium sprite"
result = processor.process_order_text(order_text)

print(f"Restaurant: {result.preferred_order.restaurant_name}")
print(f"Items: {len(result.preferred_order.items)}")
print(f"Total: ${result.preferred_order.total_amount:.2f}")
```

### Rule-Based Parser
```python
from src.baseline_order_parser import BaselineOrderParser

# Initialize parser with menu database
parser = BaselineOrderParser(menu_database)

# Parse order with restaurant detection
order = parser.parse_order_text("two crunchwrap supremes with extra sour cream")

print(f"Detected Restaurant: {order.restaurant_name}")
for item in order.items:
    print(f"- {item.quantity}x {item.name} (${item.price})")
```

### LLM-Enhanced Processing
```python
from src.llm_order_parser import LLMOrderParser

# Initialize LLM parser (requires Ollama)
llm_parser = LLMOrderParser(menu_database)

# Process complex natural language
order = llm_parser.parse_order_text(
    "I want a large coffee with oat milk and extra shot, and maybe a breakfast sandwich"
)

print(f"Processed {len(order.items)} items with LLM understanding")
```
